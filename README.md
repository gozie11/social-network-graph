# social-network-graph
##### I want to facilitate building strong and meaningful relationship networks. How many people out there have suffered from diminishing relationships with people they love simply because they don't live in proximity of them? You may say that the introduction of phones and facetime should have eliminated the problem, but in many cases this is not true. 

##### People suffer from anxiety and introversion that stems from long periods of time being spent to themselves and without the contact of pwople who they truly love. This issue has been greatly exacerbated by the diminishing social interaction we all have due to the pandemic.The anxiety snowballs and leads to situations where people lose precious relationships due to the fact that they haven't the developed the muscles to communicate effectively via phone or other media. 

##### My idea is to simplify the proccess for any one facing such issues, and also provide a new means for those who don't have such issues to view their social network and create strong healthy life long relations. This tool would help with love, business, and everything else that being a social species benefits us.

##### The social network graph will provide a visual representation of your social network that updates dynamically to show which connections are the most nurtured, which ones could use a quick check in, and will also suggest ways to grow your graph by using mutuals and interests. This tool could be used in the enterprise experience as well to automate communication between team members and executives that will lead to organic growth and strengthening of any establishment. Of course notes and other talking points will automatically be screped by this tool!

##### The network will also use data scraped from past interactions with specific friends to suggest talking points, resurface old memories, and plan meetup/date ideas.

###### I need to learn more about ML to figure out how to train a model that will get better and better at classifying relationship type as well as conversation types. The model will likely be able to determine where to lead the conversation and different things to expand upon... I'm leadin ghtis to a very ambitious point and realize that I should probably just get and mvc rolled out. I'm passionate about this though and as of now I don't think I could let it die!
